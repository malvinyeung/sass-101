# Malvin & Nick - HTML5 as a Platform

## Form & Video Page
Read through and followed chapter 7 of [HTML5 Forms](http://www.anotheruiguy.com/ux-design-dev/_book/forms/README.html) to make semantic forms. Created own styling and layout to fit user pofile.

## Photo Capture Page
Followed the [Capturing Audio & Video in HTML5](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/) to get video capture working in the browser. Extended the functionality by adding an event listener to play a shutter snap sound, as well as the ability to download the captured photo.
